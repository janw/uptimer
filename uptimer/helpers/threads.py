    """Thread to enable background processing of queued items.

    Example usecase: Whenever a WriterPlugin is processing events in batches, a reader
    returning less events than the batch size, that would cause the writer to block
    indefinitely and not write a shorter batch. The ProcessingThread can subsequently
    be used to implement a timing-out write method in WriterPlugins by wrapping the
    for-loop in a context manager::

        from uptimer.helpers.threads import ProcessingThread
        from uptimer.plugins.writers import WriterPlugin

        class MyBatchWriter(WriterPlugin):
            def write_callback(self, payload):
                # Actually do something with the payload (list of events) here
                self.logger.debug(payload)

            def write(self, payload):
                with ProcessingThread(self.write_callback) as processor:
                    for event in payload:
                        processor.put(event)

    The ProcessingThread expects the first argument to be the callback that should be
    used to write out the data. In practice this means that a writer using the
    ProcessingThread has its writing logic in the callback instead of :meth:`write`.

        All arguments given in addition to the ones mentioned below (wrapped up in
        `kwargs` will be forwarded to the callback. This allows additional (static)
        data to be forwarded to the callback. This is useful when the ProcessingThread
        is not initialized in a class context (where `self` isn't available as a method
        of passing data), or when the data can not be made available through the class
        context (for example when wrapped in a context manager).

            callback (:obj:`callable`): Method or function to be called when the
                processing thread flushes data from the queue. The callback is expected
                to take *one* positional argument, being a list of objects pulled from
                the processing queue. See :meth:`callback` below for an example
                function signature.
            page_size (int): A value greater zero being the maximum size of one page
                retrieved from the queue. This is the number of objects/events that the
                callback can/should handle when called. Be aware that the callback may
                receive pages shorter than this value, when the queue is flushed
                prematurely.
            block (bool): If retrieving an element from the queue should be blocking
                for :attr:`timeout` seconds. See :obj:`queue.Queue.get` for a more
                detailed description of the behavior.
            timeout (float): For what duration retrieving an element from the queue
                should block when :attr:`block` is `True`. See :obj:`queue.Queue.get`
                for a more detailed description of the behavior.
