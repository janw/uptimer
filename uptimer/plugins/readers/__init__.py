    """Abstract Base Class for reader plugins in uptimer.

    All reader plugins in uptimer must implement the :meth:`read` and
    :meth:`dummy_read` methods, that get called in the main application loop. When
    uptimer is running dummy data mode (by setting the :data:`DUMMY_DATA`
    environment variable / setting), the `dummy_read` method will be called instead of
    the `read` method.

    Plugin developers are asked to develop `read` and `dummy_read` in close conjuction
    with one another. `dummy_read`'s purpose is to output fake data that closely
    resembles the "real" data output by `read` so that uptimer can run all plugins
    in an enclosed environment that does not allow connections to external data
    sources. This is especially useful for end-to-end tests before deployment.
